2. Name three companies who created an algorithm that made them successful.

a) Facebook uses an algorithm to order posts on a news feed. This was revolutionary because it ordered posts based on what was most relevant to the user, centering around friends and family rather than spam ads.
b) Apple uses an algorithm for its auto correct feature. This algorithm is famous because it is not only able to interpret spelling/grammatical errors, but also can learn new vocabulary based on words/abbreviations/etc. most used by the user in order to enhance its suggestions
c) Twitter uses an algorithm to suggest new accounts for the user to follow. This allows the user to find new and relevant accounts based on what you already follow, allowing for expansion of the user's social media connections.

3. The most efficient algorithm utilizes the quickest/least amount of steps in order to achieve the goal. Efficiency is key in determining the best algorithm.
